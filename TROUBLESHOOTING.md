# The extension does not show up in *Settings -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions*
This error means Dewesoft is failing to register the plugin.
1. Run *DEWESoftX DCOM Registration* by searching for it in *Windows Search* or by finding it in the install folder *DewesoftX\App\Bin64\DCOMReg.exe*
2. Follow the steps in the image below. (1. clean addons, 2. check addons, 3. register, 4. Confirm DeltaRMC64.dll says 'OK')
3. Restart Dewesoft
If the extension still does not show up, DeltaRMC64.dll is probably not in the correct location. Retry the steps in *Installation -> Install Plugin*
